		<h1>The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</h1>


		<p>From western Philadelphia I hail <br>
		where in my youth I'd play upon the green <br>
		'til - rue the day! -I found myself assail'd <br>
		by ruffians contemptible and mean. <br>
		Although the spat was trivial and brief, <br> 
		it wounded my dear mother deep within; <br>
		and so, to give her conscience sweet relief, <br> 
		she sent me forth to live amongst her kin. <br>
		When to my port of call I'd been conveyed, <br>
		I came upon a coachman most unique; <br>
		and yet, I simply took the trip and paid, <br>
		despite his cab's decor and fresh mystique. <br>
		I survey all the land with princely mien <br>
		in fair Bel-Air, where I do lay my scene. </p>
